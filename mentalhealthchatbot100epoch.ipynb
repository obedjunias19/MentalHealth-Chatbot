Regular exercise and meditation helps in preventing anxiety and depression.\n2. Keep yourself busy with work or any activity that interests you.\n3. Connect with others regularly. Social isolation leads to anxiety and depression.\n4. Get enough sleep every night. Lack of sleep causes problems with thinking and concentration during the day.\n5. Take care of your physical health. A diet high in fat and low in vegetables contributes to mental illnesses like Depression.\n6. Avoid alcohol and illicit drugs. Substances like cocaine and methamphetamine are stimulants and depressants at the same time. They significantly affect brain function and cause severe changes in mood.\n7. Stay away from street medications sold illegally on the streets. The contents are often unknown and may be dangerous combinations of substances.\n8. Learn how to relax and use mindfulness practices to cope better with stress. Meditation has been shown to reduce symptoms of several mental disorders.\n9. Engage in activities you used to enjoy again after an episode of depression or anxiety. These will help your recovery. Talking therapy along with medication aids healing and improves prognosis.\n10. Join support groups where you learn ways to deal with your illness and meet other people who have either recovered or are still struggling with these conditions.

Regular exercise and meditation helps in preventing anxiety and depression.\n2. Keep yourself busy with work or any activity that interests you.\n3. Connect with others regularly. Social isolation leads to anxiety and depression.\n4. Get enough sleep and rest. Avoid caffeine, alcohol and other stimulants.\n5. Take medications as prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop abruptly.\n6. Attend support groups for patients with similar conditions. Participate actively in their activities. Listening to fellow sufferers could help dispel many myths associated with these illnesses.\n7. Learn relaxation techniques like yoga and/or mindfulness-based stress reduction.\n8. Join an organization representing people with mental health problems such as Bipolar International if from outside Canada.\n9. Engage in meaningful occupation that gives you a sense of purpose. Volunteering brings meaning to one's life. Doing something positive for others takes your mind off your troubles.\n10. Treating co-existing substance use disorder improves response to antidepressant treatment. So do services provided by psychiatric rehabilitation programs.\n11. Explore spiritual options. Many persons doing well despite severe limitations have attributed a religious significance to their recovery.

I don't enjoy socialising. I feel lonely most of the times. What should I do to get better.?\n      <ASSISTANT>: 1. Consult a psychiatrist and find out what type of depressive disorder you are suffering from. There are different types of depressve disorders such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder etc. depending on the severity of symptoms. Your doctor will devise a treatment plan based on the type of depressive disorder you are suffering from. Treatment may include medication, psychotherapy or both. In rare cases when therapeutic response remains unmanageable, psychiatrists might consider electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT has been found to be safe and effective in severe refractory depression but it needs to be performed by an experienced team due to risk of adverse effects. It should always be considered as a rescue measure after other less invasive measures have failed to bring about any improvement in your condition.\n2. Along with medications, there is also a strong emphasis on counselling along with medications like antidepressants. Talking to a trained counsellor can help you understand your disease better and enable quicker remission. Joining support groups where you learn ways of coping up with the illness and hear first hand experiences of fellow sufferers helps take some mental burden that comes with a diagnosis of depression. You would realise that you are not alone and many others too are struggling with similar issues. This realisation often takes away a lot of negative feelings associated with\n-------------------------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
